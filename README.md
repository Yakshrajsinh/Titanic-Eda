# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The analysis focuses on relationships between survival and attributes such as **gender, passenger class, age, fare, and embarkation port**.

The application is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** and follows a **menu-driven approach**, making it easy to use and extend.
